        Why Study in India?
Why is India a great destination to study as an international student
India&#39;s diversity and history offer a wide array of options for any student. India&#39;s
educational system is as vast and diverse as the country itself. While living in India can
be challenging for international students, it is an affordable and rewarding experience.
A millennia-old civilization, the birthplace of four world religions, a dazzling diversity of
cultures, languages, and traditions, and breathtaking natural beauty – from the soaring
Himalayas to the deserts of Rajasthan. The real question is not “why study in India?”,
but “why wouldn&#39;t you?” While India has much to offer the traveler, it also has much to
offer students. With access both to such rich history and diversity as well as a rapidly
growing country on the cutting edge of the technological revolution, studying in India
has much to offer, whether your interests are in Classics or Computers, Philosophy or
Politics.
India&#39;s educational system is as encompassing and as diverse as its history, making
studying in India unlike anywhere else. India is the home of the world&#39;s largest university
by enrollment, Indira Gandhi National Open University, with 3.5 million students. India&#39;s
higher education system has 575 university-level institutions, including:
 42 central universities, which are controlled by National Department of Higher
Education.
 243 state universities, which are run by state governments
 130 deemed universities, which are autonomously run
 53 private universities
 33 institutes of national importance, which are deemed to be of special
importance and typically focus on science and technology
Additionally, over 30,000 colleges operate throughout India, offering more specialized
instruction, often in technical fields like engineering. With all these options, international
students in India can find a program to suit them no matter what their interests.
India&#39;s degree system is influenced by the British higher education and offers
bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s, and doctoral degrees.
The Indian Government&#39;s Department of Higher Education offers more information on
specific universities in India and the higher education system.
