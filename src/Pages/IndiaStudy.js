                    <p className="section-title">India&#39;s diversity and history offer a wide array of options for any student. India&#39;s
educational system is as vast and diverse as the country itself. While living in India can
be challenging for international students, it is an affordable and rewarding experience.
A millennia-old civilization, the birthplace of four world religions, a dazzling diversity of
cultures, languages, and traditions, and breathtaking natural beauty – from the soaring
Himalayas to the deserts of Rajasthan. The real question is not “why study in India?”,
but “why wouldn&#39;t you?” While India has much to offer the traveler, it also has much to
offer students. With access both to such rich history and diversity as well as a rapidly
growing country on the cutting edge of the technological revolution, studying in India
has much to offer, whether your interests are in Classics or Computers, Philosophy or
Politics.</p>
